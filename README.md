> [!NOTE]
> The calculator was developed especially to be an example of an Abitti 2 application. The source code, the Abitti 2 container, and precompiled binaries of the calculator are made available to the public for demonstration purposes only. The matriculation examination board does not provide support for e.g. installing the precompiled binaries.

> We request that any errors in the program are reported to Abitti-support (abitti@ylioppilastutkinto.fi)

## Development Setup

Clone this repository and make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system. The exact version used in development can be found in the [`.nvmrc` file](./.nvmrc).

If you want to develop the desktop application, you will additionally need to have a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) toolchain installed on your system. Please then also follow the [Tauri set-up instructions for your system](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites/).

When Node.js is ready and this repository has been cloned, install the packages by running the following in the cloned directory:

```bash
npm install
```

After all the required packages have been installed, run one of the following commands to start the development server:

- For the web-application only:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- For the web-application and the desktop application:
  ```bash
  npm run tauri dev
  ```

## Tests

This project uses the [Vitest testing framework](https://vitest.dev) for unit tests and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) for UI tests. After the project has been [set up](#installation), to run all the tests for the project you can simply run:

```bash
npm run test
```

To run only the unit tests:

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

And to only run the UI tests:

```bash
npm run test:ui
```

Please see the Vitest and/or Playwright documentation for details on e.g. how to filter which tests to run etc.
